# AndroidBaseApplication
This is a base android application template that has custom views, login screen, signup screen.

## NOTE
- Currently, I have not placed dummy images or dummy strings in the app to make it usable as is. It is a helper library to get you started with building your app.
- This template utilizes fragments and is designed to be used with a tab bar application (although it wouldn't be hard to convert to another format such as a slide bar)
- This template assumes that you want a content list view on the left and content view on the right when displayed on a tablet.
- This app includes libraries such as SugarOrm and Spice (which I wrote or contributed too) in order to allow for offline caching of JSON responses (after parsing them into model objects)
- This is mostly used for personal use so documentation is limitted, however I would be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.
